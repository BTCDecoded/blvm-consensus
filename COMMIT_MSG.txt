feat(spam-filter): enhance spam detection with Taproot support and improved accuracy

Implement comprehensive improvements to spam filtering. All improvements
are policy-only, maintain backward compatibility, and are fully configurable.

- Fix witness size calculation to include varint overhead (1-9 bytes per element)
- Add Taproot-specific spam detection (annexes and large control blocks)
- Improve envelope protocol detection with OP_ENDIF verification
- Improve fee rate calculation with UTXO set support and heuristic fallback
- Add total witness size check across all inputs (optional, disabled by default)
- Improve BRC-20 detection with JSON validation and simple pattern fallback
- Add 10 new configuration options to SpamFilterConfig with sensible defaults
- Update SpamFilterConfigSerializable with all new fields
- Update From implementations for bidirectional config conversion
- Update filter_comparison.md documentation with all improvements
- Add script_analyzer module with ScriptType and TransactionType detection
- Implement adaptive witness size thresholds based on script type (P2WPKH, P2WSH, P2TR, MultiSig)
- Add multi-element witness analysis to detect data splitting patterns
- Add transaction type detection (consolidation, CoinJoin, payment channel) to reduce false positives
- Add preset configuration system (Disabled, Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)
- Add WitnessElementAnalysis for comprehensive witness pattern detection
- Add TransactionType::recommended_size_value_ratio() for context-aware thresholds
- Refactor spam_filter.rs into spam_filter/mod.rs module structure
- Add comprehensive tests for all new features (presets, transaction types, adaptive thresholds)

This significantly improves spam detection accuracy, especially for Taproot-based
Ordinals and inscriptions, while reducing false positives for legitimate transactions
(consolidations, CoinJoins) through adaptive, context-aware thresholds. All changes
maintain full backward compatibility and policy-only enforcement (no consensus changes).
