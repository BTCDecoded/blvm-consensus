This crate provides pure, side-effect-free functions that implement the mathematical specifications defined in the Orange Paper. It serves as the mathematical foundation for Bitcoin consensus validation with **formal verification** ensuring mathematical correctness.

## Architecture Position

This is **Tier 2** of the 5-tier Bitcoin Commons architecture (BLLVM technology stack):

```
1. bllvm-spec (Orange Paper - mathematical foundation)
2. bllvm-consensus (pure math implementation) ← THIS CRATE
3. bllvm-protocol (Bitcoin abstraction)
4. bllvm-node (full node implementation)
5. bllvm-sdk (governance infrastructure)
```

## Core Functions

This crate implements all major Bitcoin consensus functions from the Orange Paper:

### Transaction Validation
- Transaction structure and limit validation
- Input validation against UTXO set
- Script execution and verification

### Block Validation
- Block connection and validation
- Transaction application to UTXO set
- Proof of work verification

### Economic Model
- Block reward calculation
- Total supply computation
- Difficulty adjustment

### Mempool Protocol
- Transaction mempool validation
- Standard transaction checks
- Transaction replacement (RBF) logic

### Mining Protocol
- Block creation from mempool
- Block mining and nonce finding
- Block template generation

### Chain Management
- Chain reorganization handling
- P2P network message processing

### Advanced Features
- **SegWit**: Witness data validation and weight calculation
- **Taproot**: P2TR output validation and key aggregation


## Design Principles

1. **Pure Functions**: All functions are deterministic and side-effect-free
2. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Direct implementation of Orange Paper specifications
3. **Exact Version Pinning**: All consensus-critical dependencies pinned to exact versions
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test coverage with integration tests
5. **No Consensus Rule Interpretation**: Only mathematical implementation
6. **Formal Verification**: Kani model checking and property-based testing ensure correctness

## Formal Verification

This crate implements **mathematical verification** of Bitcoin consensus rules using:

- **Kani Model Checker**: Symbolic verification with bounded model checking
- **Property-Based Testing**: Randomized testing with `proptest` to discover edge cases
- **Mathematical Specifications**: Formal documentation of consensus invariants
- **CI Enforcement**: Automated verification blocks merge if proofs fail

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Run all tests and verification
cargo test --all-features

# Run Kani model checking
cargo kani --features verify

# Run property tests only
cargo test --test property_tests

# Run specific verification
cargo kani --features verify --harness kani_verify_function
```

### Verification Status

✅ **Chain Selection**: `should_reorganize`, `calculate_chain_work` verified  
✅ **Block Subsidy**: `get_block_subsidy` halving schedule verified  
✅ **Proof of Work**: `check_proof_of_work`, target expansion verified  
✅ **Transaction Validation**: `check_transaction` structure rules verified  
✅ **Block Connection**: `connect_block` UTXO consistency verified  

See [docs/VERIFICATION.md](docs/VERIFICATION.md) for detailed verification documentation.

## Dependencies
