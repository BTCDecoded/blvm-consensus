# Local development configuration for blvm-consensus
# 
# Copy this file to .cargo/config.toml to use local blvm-spec-lock during development
# This file is NOT committed to git - it's for local use only
#
# Dependency resolution priority:
# 1. Default: Use crate from crates.io (blvm-spec-lock = "^0.1.0" - allows compatible updates)
# 2. Fallback: Git dependency (CI clones repo if crate not available)
# 3. Local dev: Path dependency via this config file (only when developing locally)
